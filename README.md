### Electronics Engineer | currently studying for a Master's in Computer Science | Embedded Systems Researcher | IoT & Firmware Developer

---

I graduated in **Electronic Engineering from UTFPR** and I'm currently studying for a Master's in **Computer Sciente at Unioeste**. As a passionate **Researcher** at UTFPR, my strong focus lies in **Embedded Systems** and **IoT solutions**. My expertise involves crafting efficient and robust firmware for microcontrollers like the **ESP32** and **STM32**, with a particular interest in **LoRa communication** for cutting-edge IoT deployments.

I thrive on solving complex challenges and contributing to the advancement of technology. My research has led to a publication in the **IEEE Xplore for the SBESC symposium**.

### What I'm currently focused on:
* Currently working in a **LoRa-based air quality monitoring station**.
* **Advancing IoT solutions** with robust LoRa communication.
* Exploring new paradigms in **firmware development** for embedded systems.
* Applying **FreeRTOS** in real-time embedded applications.
* Deepening my understanding of **communication protocols** beyond LoRa, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ESP-NOW.

### My Latest Contribution:

* In collaboration with my colleagues, I contributed to this publication for the SBESC symposium: **[An Angular Position-Based Tracking Algorithm for Geolocation in Smart Cities Applications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771930)** - This work aims to develop an algorithm that is able to determine the location of a moving object based on its angular position, the results show that the angle-based algorithm reduces the number of transmitted coordinates by up to 30%.
